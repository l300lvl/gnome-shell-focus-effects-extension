##Note: The quick hacks in this 3.6 fork remove the desaturation so that all windows become transparent,
except for the focused window. This for some reason breaks the focus on the main window, which seems to be more
frequently broken if the window is max'd/full screen. It can be remedied sometimes by opening a configuartion box
of that window e.g about, sometimes.


## Gnome shell focus effects extension

This extension allows you to add custom effects on window focus/blur.
By default it adds a clutter desaturation and an opacity effect.
You can however customize these effects by editing a file named ~/.ffxrc.json and then switching off and on the extension in gnome-tweak-tool.

To install, simply clone this repository and put 'focus-effects@paradoxxx.zero.gmail.com/' in ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions.
Or you can add it with gnome-tweak-tool.
